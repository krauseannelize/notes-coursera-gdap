## Understanding bias in data

***Bias*** is having preferences based on preconceived or subconscious notions, which can lead to skewed results and unreliable data. Biased data leads to inaccurate conclusions with real-world consequences, such as the historical under-representation of women in health studies results in misdiagnosis and delayed treatment today due to a lack of inclusive data.

| Bias type | Definition | Avoidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sampling** | A sample isn’t representative of the population as a whole, leading to skewed results | Ensure the sample is chosen at random, so all parts of the population have an equal chance of being included |
| **Observer** | The tendency for different people to observe things differently (also referred to as experimenter bias or research bias) | Ensure consistent measurement methods and be aware of personal biases that may influence observations |
| **Interpretation** | The tendency to interpret ambiguous situations in a consistently positive or negative way | Seek multiple perspectives to reduce the influence of personal experiences on data interpretation |
| **Confirmation** | The tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs | Actively seek out and consider information that challenges preexisting beliefs to ensure a balanced view |

## Identifying good data sources

Accurate, complete, and unbiased data is crucial for making informed decisions. Reliable data sources provide trustworthy information that has been vetted and proven suitable for use. To remember the key characteristic of good data sources, use the acronym ***ROCCC***.

| ROCCC | Characteristic |
| --- | --- |
| **Reliable** | Data should be accurate, complete, and unbiased, vetted for use |
| **Original** | Always validate data with the original source, even if found through secondary sources |
| **Comprehensive** | Data must contain all critical information needed to answer questions or find solutions |
| **Current** | Data should be up-to-date and relevant to the task at hand |
| **Cited** | Consider who created the data, if they’re part of a credible organization, and when it was last refreshed |

Using bad data can have serious and lasting impacts, such as:

- incorrect conclusions that lead to bad business decision,
- inaccurate information that cause processes to fail and put populations at risk.

## Data ethics and privacy

***Ethics*** refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness or specific virtues. ***Data ethics*** refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used.

### Aspects of data ethics

#### Ownership

Individuals own the raw data they provide and have primary control over its usage, processing, and sharing.

#### Transaction transparency

All data processing activities and algorithms should be explainable and understandable to the data provider.

#### Consent

Individuals have the right to know how and why their data will be used before providing it.

#### Currency

Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions.

#### Privacy

Preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. Sometimes called information privacy or data protection, this means individuals should have:

- protection from unauthorized access to their private data
- freedom from inappropriate use of their data
- the right to inspect, update, or correct their data
- ability to give consent to use their data, and
- legal right to access their data

#### Openness

Refers to free access, usage, and sharing of data. For data to be considered open, it has to meet all 3 these standards:

- Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset
- Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed
- Allow universal participation without discrimination so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data"

### Data anonymization

***Personally identifiable information (PII)*** is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity. ***Data anonymization*** is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating that kind of information. ***De-identification*** is a process used to wipe data clean of all personally identifying information. Data that is often anonymized:

- Telephone numbers
- Names
- License plates and license numbers
- Social security numbers
- IP addresses
- Medical records
- Email addresses
- Photographs
- Account numbers

## Open data

***Open data*** refers to the unrestricted access, usage, and sharing of data, provided it adheres to ethical considerations like transparency, privacy, and consent. The benefits of open data include wider use of credible databases, enhanced scientific collaboration, and improved decision-making across various fields.

***Interoperability*** is the key to the success of open data and is the ability of data systems to seamlessly connect and share data. An example of interoperability can be found in the healthcare sector, where hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies can share patient information securely and efficiently.
