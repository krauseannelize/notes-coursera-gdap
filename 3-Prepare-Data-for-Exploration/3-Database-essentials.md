## Work with databases

***Databases*** store and organize data in tables with information. A ***relational database*** is a database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships. Here is a sample database structure:

![Database Structure](/images/database-structure.png 'Database Structure')

For two tables to have a relationship, one or more of the same fields must exist inside both tables which are called primary or foreign keys. A ***primary key*** is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique. A ***foreign key*** is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table. A table can have only one primary key, but it can have multiple foreign keys.

Some tables such as the revenue table above do not require a primary key, but have multiple foreign keys instead. An alternative primary key, called a  ***composite key***, can be created by combining two or more columns together that uniquely identify a row in a database table. For example:

- `Author ID` can be associated with multiple books
- `Title ID` can be associated with multiple authors
- The combination of `Author ID` and `Title ID` uniquely identifies a specific book.

***Structured Query Language (SQL)*** is the tool that enables data analysts to interact with relational databases using queries to extract specific information.

## Activity: Inspect a dataset

In this activity, we are guided through the process of inspecting a dataset to determine whether the data provided is sufficient to answer stakeholder questions. My analysis of the activity **"Inspect a dataset"** can be viewed [here](/activities/spreadsheets/c03m03-ice-cream-sales-analysis.md).

## Metadata

***Metadata*** is data about data. In database management, metadata provides information about other data and helps data analysts interpret the contents of the data within a database.
