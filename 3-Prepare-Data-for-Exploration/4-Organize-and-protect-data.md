## Benefits of organizing data

- Makes it easier to find and use
- Helps you avoid making mistakes during your analysis
- Helps to protect your data

## Best practices when organizing data

| Practice | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **Naming conventions** | Consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name. Use logical and descriptive names for your files to make them easier to find and use |
| **Foldering** | Organizing your files into folders helps keep project-related files together in one place |
| **Archiving** | Move old projects to a separate location to create an archive and cut down on clutter |
| **Align your naming and storage practices with your team** | This avoids any confusion |
| **Develop metadata practices** | Such as creating a file that outlines project naming conventions for easy reference |
| **Relational databases** | Avoid data duplication and contradicting data, while also optimizing storage |

## Data Security

**Data security** is about protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption, ensuring sensitive data is inaccessible to unauthorized users. There are different measures to secure your data:

| Measure | How it secures your data |
| --- | --- |
| **Encryption** | Uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications without the algorithm, which is saved as a “key” used to reverse the encryption |
| **Tokenization** | Replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token.” Original data is stored separately and mapped to the tokens so even if tokenized data is hacked, the original data is still safe. Without permission to use the tokenized data and the token mapping, the data cannot be accessed |
| **Version control** | Version control enables all collaborators within a file to track changes over time to avoid confusion and overwriting work |
