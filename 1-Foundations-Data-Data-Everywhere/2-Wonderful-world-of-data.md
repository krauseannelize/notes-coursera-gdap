## Data life cycle

The **data ecosystem** consists of various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share data. It is a holistic approach to managing data throughout its entire lifecycle, ensuring its value and quality for various purposes.

| Stage | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Plan** | Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it |
| **Capture** | Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources |
| **Manage** | Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so |
| **Analyze** | Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals |
| **Archive** | Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference |
| **Destroy** | Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data |

Each stage in the lifecycle of data ensures that data is handled effectively and securely throughout its existence. It is important to understand the data life cycle as it helps you approach data analysis more effectively. It provides a framework for managing data from its initial planning stages to its eventual retirement. Individual stages in the data life cycle will vary from company to company or by industry.

:zap: DO NOT confuse the six stages of the data life cycle (plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive, and destroy) with the six phases of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act) as they are not interchangeable.
