## Data analyst job opportunities

Data analysts work in a wide range of industries like technology, marketing, finance, health care, and more. Some examples of how data analytics are used in real life to:

- **Revolutionize Marketing:** Companies like Coca-Cola use data from sources like AI-powered vending machines to understand consumer preferences and tailor their advertising campaigns.
- **Powering Search Engines:** Google relies heavily on data to determine website reliability and accuracy, ensuring users receive the most relevant search results.
- **Empower Small Businesses:** Small businesses can use data to better understand their customers' buying habits, create more effective social media messaging, or, in the case of one city zoo and aquarium, predict the number of daily visitors based on local climate data.
- **Improving Healthcare:** Hospitals can leverage data to anticipate peak hours, optimize staffing levels, and reduce patient wait times, ultimately improving the overall healthcare experience.

The first few years of one's career are typically dedicated to building a strong foundation of general skills.
As professionals progress, they often specialize in specific areas, such as SQL expertise for financial analysis. There are a diverse range of career paths available and you won't be bound to one industry alone.

 ## The importance of fair business decisions

Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions. It starts with a business task, which is the question or problem data analysis answers for business. Data analysts ask the right questions, plan out the best way to gather and analyze data, and then present it visually to enable informed, data-driven decision-making to guide business strategy. It is the responsibility of a data analyst to make sure they are gathering, analyzing, and presenting data in a way that's fair to the people being represented by that data.

Fairness in data analysis means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias.  While conclusions drawn from data might be technically accurate, they can still be unfair if they don't consider the broader social context. If the analysis is not objective, the conclusions can be misleading and even harmful. For example, in a male dominated company, an analysis of employee performance could draw the unfair conclusion that only men are succeeding and therefore more men should be hired. This analysis fails to consider all of the available data or surrounding factors that impact the data such as that other genders are grossly underrepresented. An ethical and fair analysis would conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance, painting a more complete and fair picture.

## Fairness best practices

| Best practice | Example |
| --- | --- |
| **Consider all of the available data** | In measuring traffic patters on holidays, only including metrics relating to traffic volumes and which days are holidays may not sufficient. Adding weather data to the analysis to see how it affects traffic volume helps to gain a more complete picture |
| **Identify surrounding factors** | To anticipate staffing needs to plan for employee vacation time, only using a list of national bank holidays may introduce bias against employees who celebrate other important holidays that aren't bank holidays |
| **Include self-reported data** | Considering fairness when collecting data to learn more about a customer base, a survey that enables customers to self-report information about themselves can avoid bias that can be introduced with other demographic data collection methods such as observation bias |
| **Use oversampling effectively** | To release new digital content for users, increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population such as users age 70 or older, can help you better represent them and address imbalanced datasets to release more inclusive content |
| **Think about fairness from beginning to end** | Communicating all fairness consideration when presenting your data after including fairness measures in the data-collection process such as oversampling and using self-reported data, will help stakeholders to not get a skewed understanding of the data |

## Data ethics

We need to not only consider what is the right way of using data, but also whether those uses are going to be beneficial to people. 
Data ethics is not only about minimizing harm, but actively acting in the best interest of others and promoting well-being. Consider:

- Who is collecting the data?
- Why are they collecting it?
- How are they collecting it?
- How is this going to benefit people?

You have a responsibility to those people that are represented in the data to keep aspects of their data protected and private. We need to consider mechanisms of giving users and consumers more control over their data by being able to give consent to the use of their data and the ability to revoke their consent. As data continues to grow, people need to be empowered to have control over their own data.
