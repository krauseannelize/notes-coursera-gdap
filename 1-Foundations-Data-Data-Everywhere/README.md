## Introducing data analytics and analytical thinking

> “Data! Data! Data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay.”  
> *- Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of the Copper Beeches - a Sherlock Holmes Short Story*

The foundation on which data analysis is built is data. Data analysts need data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and inform decisions.

### Data analytics knowledge

Data analysts must have a comprehensive understanding of the data analytics process, which is evidence by:

- a thorough understanding of data-driven decision-making and how it helps organizations guide their business strategy based on facts,
- knowing how to ask questions and make hypotheses about business problems, and how to use them as guidance through the data analysis process,
- the ability to verify data credibility and perform data validation,
- an understanding of data modeling and know how organizations use it as a tool to understand their data, and
- effectively communicate analysis insights to stakeholders by selecting and designing visualization.

### Data analytics technical skills

Data analyst must have the technical skills that allow them to complete the data analysis process. They use a variety of tools to analyze data such as spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and R to:

- join data from multiple sources to use for data analysis,
- sort data in both spreadsheets and databases,
- clean data by ensuring it contains no duplicate or incorrect entries, and that it is in the correct format,
- create data visualizations using spreadsheets, Tableau, and R,
- write SQL commands to select several columns from a table,
- select and install packages in R to complete specific tasks.

By using **structured thinking**, we can break the data analysis process into smaller, more manageable parts by following this process:

| Step | Task | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Ask** | Define the problem and confirm stakeholder expectations |
| 2 | **Prepare** | Collect and store data for analysis |
| 3 | **Process** | Clean and transform data to ensure integrity |
| 4 | **Analyze** | Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions |
| 5 | **Share** | Interpret and communicate results to others to make data-driven decisions |
| 6 | **Act** | Put your insights to work in order to solve the original problem |

This process involves four basic activities:

- recognizing the current problem or situation,
- organizing available information,
- revealing gaps and opportunities, and
- identifying available options
