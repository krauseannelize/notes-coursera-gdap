## Introduction

Data can empower our decisions and in this course we will learn:

- the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, how to analyze them and how they can work together;
- the pros and cons of different data visualization tools;
- what metrics are and how analysts use them; and
- how to use mathematical thinking to connect the dots.

## Data empowers decisions

> "Every single action that we do in this world is triggering off some amount of data, and most of that data is meaningless until someone adds some interpretation of it or someone adds a narrative around it."
>
> *-Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square*

There are two ways we can use data to make better decisions:

|  | DATA-DRIVEN | DATA-INSPIRED |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Meaning** | Using quantity and quality of readily-available data to arrive at a decision | Explores data-driven considerations while also considering broader ideas, feelings, experiences, and qualitative information to find out what they have in common |
| **Pros** | Greatly improve decision-making when data is sufficient and unbiased | Avoids some pitfalls of data-driven decisions by valuing a wider range of inputs |
| **Cons** | Potential over-reliance on historical data, ignoring qualitative insights and biases in data collection and analysis | Challenges in quantifying qualitative insights and balancing them with data |

Different kinds of questions make different kinds of data. There are two data types:

|  | QUANTITATIVE DATA | QUALITATIVE DATA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Specific and objective measures of numerical facts | Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data |
| **Questions** | What? How many? How often? | Why? |
| **Data Tools** | Structured interviews, surveys, polls | Focus groups, social media text analysis, in-person interviews |

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation.

## Metrics

A ***metric*** is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. Data is a collection of raw facts until organized into individual metrics that represent a single type of data. Examples of metrics:

- Revenue
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Customer Retention Rate

Different industries use all kinds of different metrics, and they are all trying to meet a specific goal by measuring data. This ***metric goal*** is a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

## Data visualization tools

There are many tools to visualize and share data analysis with stakeholders. Two useful data presentation tools are reports and dashboards.

### Reports

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| High-level historical data | Continual maintenance |
| Easy to design | Less visually appealing |
| Pre-cleaned and sorted data | Static |

### Dashboards

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic, automatic and interactive | Labor-intensive design |
| More stakeholder access | Can be confusing |
| Low maintenance | Potentially uncleaned data |

### Spreadsheets

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Basic data visualization capabilities | Limited visualization capabilities |
| Data cleaning and manipulation | Static nature |
| Integration with other tools | No large dataset capability |

### Tableau

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Powerful visualization capabilities | Steep learning curve |
| Interactive and dynamic | Requires data preparation and cleaning |
| Large dataset capability | Expensive |

## Design compelling dashboards

### Benefits of dashboards

| Benefits | For data analysts | For stakeholders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Centralization** | Share a single source of data with all stakeholders | Work with a comprehensive view of data, initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more |
| **Visualization** | Show and update live, incoming data in real time | Spot changing trends and patterns more quickly |
| **Insightfulness** | Pull relevant information from different datasets | Understand the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions |
| **Customization** | Create custom views dedicated to a specific person, project, or presentation of the data | Drill down to more specific areas of specialized interest or concern |

### Create a dashboard

The process to follow to create a dashboard:

1. Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it
2. Design the dashboard (what should be displayed)
3. Create mockups if desired
4. Select the visualizations
5. Create filters as needed
