## Introduction

Data can empower our decisions and in this course we will learn:

- the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, how to analyze them and how they can work together;
- the pros and cons of different data visualization tools;
- what metrics are and how analysts use them; and
- how to use mathematical thinking to connect the dots.

## Data empowers decisions

> "Every single action that we do in this world is triggering off some amount of data, and most of that data is meaningless until someone adds some interpretation of it or someone adds a narrative around it."
>
> *-Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square*

There are two ways we can use data to make better decisions:

|  | DATA-DRIVEN | DATA-INSPIRED |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Meaning** | Using quantity and quality of readily-available data to arrive at a decision | Explores data-driven considerations while also considering broader ideas, feelings, experiences, and qualitative information to find out what they have in common |
| **Pros** | Greatly improve decision-making when data is sufficient and unbiased | Avoids some pitfalls of data-driven decisions by valuing a wider range of inputs |
| **Cons** | Potential over-reliance on historical data, ignoring qualitative insights and biases in data collection and analysis | Challenges in quantifying qualitative insights and balancing them with data |

Different kinds of questions make different kinds of data. There are two data types:

|  | QUANTITATIVE DATA | QUALITATIVE DATA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Specific and objective measures of numerical facts | Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data |
| **Questions** | What? How many? How often? | Why? |
| **Data Tools** | Structured interviews, surveys, polls | Focus groups, social media text analysis, in-person interviews |

Data analysts will generally use both types of data in their work. Qualitative data can help analysts better understand their quantitative data by providing a reason or more thorough explanation.

## Metrics

A ***metric*** is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. Data is a collection of raw facts until organized into individual metrics that represent a single type of data. Examples of metrics:

- Revenue
- Return on Investment (ROI)
- Customer Retention Rate

Different industries use all kinds of different metrics, and they are all trying to meet a specific goal by measuring data. This ***metric goal*** is a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.

## Data visualization tools

There are many tools to visualize and share data analysis with stakeholders. Two useful data presentation tools are reports and dashboards.

### Reports

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| High-level historical data | Continual maintenance |
| Easy to design | Less visually appealing |
| Pre-cleaned and sorted data | Static |

### Dashboards

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic, automatic and interactive | Labor-intensive design |
| More stakeholder access | Can be confusing |
| Low maintenance | Potentially uncleaned data |

### Spreadsheets

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Basic data visualization capabilities | Limited visualization capabilities |
| Data cleaning and manipulation | Static nature |
| Integration with other tools | No large dataset capability |

### Tableau

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Powerful visualization capabilities | Steep learning curve |
| Interactive and dynamic | Requires data preparation and cleaning |
| Large dataset capability | Expensive |

## Design compelling dashboards

### Benefits of dashboards

|   | DATA ANALYSTS | STAKEHOLDERS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Centralization** | Share a single source of data with all stakeholders | Work with a comprehensive view of data, initiatives, objectives, projects, processes, and more |
| **Visualization** | Show and update live, incoming data in real time | Spot changing trends and patterns more quickly |
| **Insightfulness** | Pull relevant information from different datasets | Understand the story behind the numbers to keep track of goals and make data-driven decisions |
| **Customization** | Create custom views dedicated to a specific person, project, or presentation of the data | Drill down to more specific areas of specialized interest or concern |

### Create a dashboard

The process to follow to create a dashboard:

1. Identify the stakeholders who need to see the data and how they will use it
2. Design the dashboard (what should be displayed)
3. Create mockups if desired
4. Select the visualizations
5. Create filters as needed

## Mathematical thinking

Using a mathematical approach to problem-solving means looking at a problem and logically breaking it down step-by-step, so you can see the relationship of patterns in your data, and use that to analyze your problem. It can help you choose the best tools for analysis by looking at different aspects of a problem and determining the best logical approach, for example dataset size will determine whether you use a spreadsheet or SQL.

The bed occupancy rate in a hospital can illustrate how data analysts use mathematical thinking to address real-world issues. By analyzing key variables like the number of open beds and beds used over time, data analysts can identify patterns and provide solutions, such as optimizing bed allocation.

## Big and small data

| Small data | Big data |
| --- | --- |
| Describes a dataset made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period | Describes large, less-specific datasets that cover a long time period |
| Usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets | Usually kept in a database and queried |
| Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses | Likely to be used by large organizations |
| Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent | Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent |
| Usually already a manageable size for analysis | Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making |

### Challenges of big data

- Data overload and too much unimportant or irrelevant information
- Important data can be hard to find leading to inefficient decision-making time frames
- Data isnâ€™t always easily accessible
- Current tools struggle to provide measurable data leading to unfair algorithmic bias
- Gaps in many big data business solutions

### Benefits of big data

- Identify more efficient ways of doing business, saving time and money
- Spot trends of buying patterns to create new products and solutions
- Better understanding of current market conditions to stay ahead of competition
- Track online presence to improve and protect brands

### The four Vs

These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex datasets:

- ***Volume:*** The amount of data
- ***Variety:*** The different kinds of data
- ***Velocity:*** How fast the data can be processed
- ***Veracity:*** The quality and reliability of the data
