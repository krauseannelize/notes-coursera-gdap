## Introduction

Data analysts are constantly asking questions to define problems, understand stakeholder needs, and gather the right data. This course aims to equip you with the skills to ask insightful questions that yield valuable data insights for solving business problems. To ask great questions, it is important to understand the difference between effective and ineffective questions, and how to apply effective questioning techniques.

## The six data analysis phases

Break the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts, using structured thinking that involves four basic activities:

- Recognizing the current problem or situation
- Organizing available information
- Revealing gaps and opportunities
- Identifying options

### Phase 1: Ask

To solve a problem, you need to know what it is:

- Define the problem you’re trying to solve
- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations
- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication
- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context
- Questions to ask yourself:
  - What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
  - How can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

### Phase 2: Prepare

Decide what data you need to collect and how to organize it usefully:

- What metrics to measure
- Locate data in your database
- Create security measures to protect that data
- Questions to ask yourself:
  - What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
  - What research do I need to do?

### Phase 3: Process

Clean up data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies:

- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data
- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries
- Checking as much as possible for bias in the data
- Questions to ask yourself:
  - What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
  - How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

### Phase 4: Analyze

Sort and format data to make it easier analyze:

- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results
- Questions to ask yourself:
  - What story is my data telling me?
  - How will my data help me solve this problem?
  - Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

### Phase 5: Share

Share analysis with clear visuals showing the process and solution to:  

- Make better decisions
- Make more informed decisions
- Leading to stronger outcomes
- Successfully communicate your findings
- Questions to ask yourself in this step:
  - How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?
  - What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

### Phase 6: Act

Take everything learnt from the data analysis and make recommendations. Questions to ask yourself:

- How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase (phase 5) to actually meet the stakeholder’s needs and expectations?

## Common problem types

| Problem type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Making predictions** | Use data to make informed decisions about how things may be in future |
| **Categorizing things** | Assign information to different groups or clusters based on common features (shared characteristics or attributes e.g. books by genre) |
| **Spotting something unusual** | Identify data that is different from the norm |
| **Identifying themes** | Takes categorization a step further by grouping information into broader concepts (identifying underlying themes e.g. finding common themes in customer reviews) |
| **Discovering connections** | Find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them |
| **Finding patterns** | Find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again |

## Things to avoid when asking questions

| Question type | Why | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Leading** | Only have a particular response | *This product is too expensive, isn’t it?* |
| **Closed-ended** | Ask for a one-word or brief response only | *Were you satisfied with the trial?* |
| **Vague** | Aren’t specific or don’t provide context | *Does the tool work for you?* |

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Action-oriented question** | A question whose answers lead to change |
| **Cloud** | A place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive |
| **Data analysis process** | The six phases of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act whose purpose is to gain insights that drive informed decision-making |
| **Data life cycle** | The sequence of stages that data experiences, which include plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive, and destroy |
| **Leading question** | A question that steers people toward a certain response |
| **Measurable question** | A question whose answers can be quantified and assessed |
| **Problem types** | The various problems that data analysts encounter, including categorizing things, discovering connections, finding patterns, identifying themes, making predictions, and spotting something unusual |
| **Relevant question** | A question that has significance to the problem to be solved |
| **SMART methodology** | A tool for determining a question’s effectiveness based on whether it is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound |
| **Specific question** | A question that is simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas |
| **Structured thinking** | The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying options |
| **Time-bound question** | A question that specifies a time frame to be studied |
| **Unfair question** | A question that makes assumptions or is difficult to answer honestly |
