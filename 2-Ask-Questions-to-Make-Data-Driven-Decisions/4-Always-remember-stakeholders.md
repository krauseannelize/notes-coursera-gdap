## Balance needs and expectations

***Stakeholders*** are people who have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you are  working on. There are three common stakeholder groups that you might find yourself working with:

| Team | Communication tip |
| --- | --- |
| **Executive** | Keep presentations concise, high-level and lead with the answers to their questions. Save detailed information in documentation for later review |
| **Customer-facing** | Focus on actual data findings rather than what stakeholders hope to find, and communicate customer feedback effectively |
| **Data science** | Collaborate and share individual analysis findings with the team to explore new angles and predict outcomes based on combined data insights |

### Working effectively with stakeholders

Use the following tips to communicate clearly, establish trust, and deliver your findings across groups:

- Discuss goals
- Feel empowered to say “no.”
- Plan for the unexpected
- Know your project
- Start with words and visuals
- Communicate often

### Focus on what matters

Focus on what will help you stay on task:

- Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
- Who is managing the data?
- Where can you go for help?

## Clear communication is key

Before you communicate, think about:

- Who are your audience?
- What do they already know?
- What do they need to know?
- How you can communicate that effectively to them?

It is important to set realistic expectations with stakeholders in data analysis projects and communicating effectively throughout the process by:

- defining the scope and data sources
- set a realistic timeline to avoid over-promising and missing deadlines
- proactively communicating any problems or delays
- adjust expectations when requested changes impacts the timeline or models

Transparent and timely communication keeps stakeholders updated on progress, build trust and ultimately helps prevent problems. This ensures that everyone will be able to better manage their own schedules, resources, and teams, ensuring smoother project execution and successful outcomes.

## Limitations of data

Be the judge! When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data.

| Limitation | Plan|
| --- | --- |
| **Incomplete or nonexistent data** | Be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available |
| **Don’t miss misaligned data** | Establish how to measure things early on to standardize the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy |
| **Deal with dirty data** | Fix or remove incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset while tracking the changes you made |
| **Tell a clear story** | 1. Compare the same types of data; 2. Visualize with care; 3. Leave out needless graphs; 4. Test for statistical significance; 5. Pay attention to sample size |
