## Introduction

Spreadsheets are essential tools for data analysts, used to organize, analyze, and visualize data, forming the basis for data-driven decisions.
They can automate calculations, saving time and providing clear insights into how results are derived. Resources for more information:

## Activity: Basic spreadsheet tasks

We received a sample dataset of the *Population of Latin and Caribbean countries from 2010 to 2019* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HalKDAXk92cWjxfjAnLOAUwwPlRtzn5w2K_mJme0OAA/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel file](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-population-lac-countries-data.xlsx). We were tasked with performing these basic spreadsheet activities:

- open a new spreadsheet
- create a new folder
- change cell size
- make attributes stand out
- add or delete columns
- add a border

As I am an advanced spreadsheet user, I used a new Google Sheets feature introduced in May 2024 **"Covert to table"** to apply automatic formatting to the table such as emphasized headers, filtering, resizing columns and naming the data range. The formatted spreadsheet can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13eJDtozw4Y7w59CeRhKBw6z8A95KU25br7WvEQVHoDQ/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel file](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-population-lac-countries-activity.xlsx).

## Activity: Formulas for success

We received a sample dataset of *Monthly Sales* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/125ahFIEOhVEmwSK0GYQeIqYuVcvYZgWNECzAtjb9_fo/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-formulas-success-data.xlsx). This activity covers the basics of using spreadsheet formulas for calculations including correcting errors and I performed the following actions in Google Sheets:

- used the **"Convert to table"** feature to apply automatic formatting
- applied consistent formatting to all numbers
- added additional columns for "Average Sales" and "June to July changes"
- calculated the "Total Sales" using the formula `=SUM(B3:E3)` instead of `=B3+C3+D3+E3`
- calculated the "Average Sales" using the formula `=AVERAGE(B2:E2)` instead of `=(B2+C2+D2+E2)/4`
- calculated the "June to July changes" using the formula `=(E2-D2)/D2`
- corrected the formula error by inserting the value 75866 for June 2019
- as the percentage change for June to July 2017 did not provide the expected result of 247.5%, I changed the June 2017 sales from 4002 to 47002
- applied percentage formatting to "June to July changes"

The completed activity can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yuHGrBhFNLR-Kaw6qXvGpzt26TDNj1HgQ-lXAawGrYw/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-formulas-success-activity.xlsx).

## Activity: Essential metrics

We received a sample dataset of *Bakery Sales March 2020* that can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oBxZKfxhjIB9XwqKmPdsa6kDbMIjgKxQsG4xUWdO6NM/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-bakery-sales-202003-data.xlsx). This activity illustrates how to use formulas to calculate essential metrics that reveal the revenue generated by each product. To this end, I performed the following actions in Google Sheets:

- used the **"Convert to table"** feature to apply automatic formatting
- added the column "Revenue"
- calculated the revenue using the formula `=C2*D2`
- create a new table with columns for "Product", "Price", "Total Sold" and "Total Revenue"
- created a visible break between the two tables by filling column F in a dark grey
- used the function `=SORT(UNIQUE(B2:B))` to extract the individual product lines instead of typing it out as indicated in the activity
- used the function `=VLOOKUP($G2,$B$2:$C$31, 2, FALSE)` to look-up the price of each product instead of typing it out as indicated in the activity
- calculated the total units sold per product line using the function `=SUMIF($B$2:$B,$G2,$D$2:$D)` instead of error prone `=D3+D8+D13+D18+D22`
- calculated the total revenue per product line using the formula `=H2*I2`
- added totals to the "Total Sold" and "Total Revenue" columns with the SUM function

The completed activity can be viewed in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qeQh2eOofs_kwiCFEKYxUIoF68P9gClfsC0aCDJXEhc/edit?usp=sharing) or the [Excel File](/activities/spreadsheets/c02m03-bakery-sales-202003-activity.xlsx).
