## Introduction

Spreadsheets are essential tools for data analysts, used to organize, analyze, and visualize data, forming the basis for data-driven decisions.
They can automate calculations, saving time and providing clear insights into how results are derived. Resources for more information:

## Spreadsheet hands-on activities

### Basic spreadsheet tasks

We received a sample dataset of the *"Population of Latin and Caribbean countries from 2010 to 2019"* that can be viewed in Google Sheets or Excel. In this activity, we were tasked with performing basic spreadsheet activities:

- open a new spreadsheet
- create a new folder
- change cell size
- make attributes stand out
- add or delete columns
- add a border

As I am an advanced spreadsheet user, I used a new Google Sheets feature introduced in May 2024 **"Covert to table"** to apply automatic formatting to the table such as emphasized headers, filtering, resizing columns and naming the data range. The formatted spreadsheet can be viewed in Google Sheets or Excel.
