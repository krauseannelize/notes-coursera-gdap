## The data analyst hiring process

The road to finding a job can be challenging. The most common way to start is by checking out available jobs. Once you've identified some promising opportunities, take the time to research the companies and tailor your resume to align with the specific requirements of each role.

During recruiter screenings, emphasize your technical skills (SQL, data cleaning) and industry knowledge to demonstrate your qualifications. Recruiters probably won't go into too much detail about the ins and outs, but they want to see that you know what you're talking about.

For hiring manager interviews, research their background and the role thoroughly, and prepare thoughtful questions to assess if the company is the right fit for you. The hiring manager's job is to evaluate whether you have the ability to do the work and whether you'd be a good fit for their team.

If you receive an offer, carefully review the terms, research competitive salaries and benefits, and don't hesitate to negotiate for what you deserve. Once you've reached an agreement, remember to give your current employer sufficient notice before starting your exciting new data analyst role.

## Build a resume

You want your resume to be a snapshot of all that you've done both in school and professionally. When managers and recruiters look at what you've included in your resume, they should be able to tell right away what you can offer their company. A resume should be concise, ideally fitting on one page, and highlight your most relevant qualifications for the desired job. Templates, available in various word processing programs and job search websites, can be very helpful in structuring and designing your resume.

Decide on a format that best suits your background and career goals, whether it's highlighting skills and qualifications or focusing on work history. Consider including a summary section that briefly outlines your strengths and how you can contribute to the company, especially if you have experience that is not traditional for a data analyst or if you're making a career transition.

> **JOB DESCRIPTION FORMULA: Accomplished X as measured by Y, by doing Z**
>
> Example: Selected as one of 275 participants nationwide for this 12-month professional development program for high- achieving talent based on leadership potential and academic success.

Key steps to creating a resume:

1. **Choose a Template:** Select a suitable template that aligns with your experience level and career goals.
2. **Decide on Format:** Determine the structure and layout, considering factors like work experience and technical skills.
3. **Prioritize Conciseness:** Aim for a one-page resume, highlighting the most relevant information.
4. **Focus on Impactful Communication:** Use clear and concise language to convey your skills and experiences.
5. **Keep the Template Handy:** Refer to the chosen template as you progress through the resume creation process.

## PAR statements

One of the most important things your resume should convey for data analytics roles is that you are a clear communicator, capable of explaining complex analyses to various audiences. One strategy you can use in your summary and throughout your resume is PAR statements (Problem, Action, Result). Instead of saying something like, "was responsible for writing two blogs a month," you'd say:

| PAR | “Earned little-known website over 2,000 new clicks through strategic blogging” |
| --- | --- |
| **Problem** | The website being little-known is the problem |
| **Action** | The strategic action is the strategic blogging |
| **Result** | And the result is the 2,000 new clicks |

Adding PAR statements to your job descriptions or skill section can help with the organization and consistency in your resume.
