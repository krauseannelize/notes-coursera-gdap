    "As a data analyst at a news station in New York City, I have been tasked with answering questions about the weather for meteorologists. The meteorologists need me to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation for stations La Guardia and JFK, for every day in 2020. They’ve also requested the data be presented to them in descending order by date and ascending order by Station ID,\n",
    "- the average temperature in June 2020, and\n",
    "- the average wind speed in December 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be working with a public dataset names `noaa_gsod` that contains global summaries of the day (GSOD) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The full path of this dataset is `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod`. The GSOD dataset includes information about daily weather elements, such as mean temperature and wind speed, from more than 9,000 weather stations across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset stores the information for every year in a different table so for the purpose of this question, I will be using the `gsod2020` table. In addition, the dataset is very large and as such I will save a subset of the New York region in a new table to make my analysis easier.\n",

    "## Query: Weather for NY region in 2020\n",

    "Before proceeding with the analysis, it will be necessary to address missing values within the dataset to ensure that only valid data points are included in the analysis. In this case, missing values were represented by a specific values in the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `temp`: Temperature = 9999.9\n",
    "- `wdsp`: Wind speed = 999.9\n",
    "- `prcp`: Precipitation = 99.99\n",
    "\n",
    "The station codes for the two stations we are interested in for the New York region are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 725030 for La Guardia\n",
    "- 744860 for JFK\n",
    "\n",
    "As it can be confusing to read the data with the Station IDs, I will add a name column with the Station name. To extract the temperature, wind speed, and precipitation for these, presented in descending order by date and ascending order by Station ID, for every day in 2020 from the dataset, the following SQL query is executed:"
