    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are provided with a zip file containing data about popular baby names from the U.S. Social Security Administration website after 1879 as of 1 March 2020. The unzipped data contains a comma-delimited file for each year from 1880 to 2019. Filenames use a consistent yobYYYY.txt format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each record is saved in the format \"name,sex,number,\" where \"number\" is the number of occurrences of the name in the specified year. Name with less that 5 occurrences have been excluded from the list to safeguard privacy. A preview of the comma-delimited file is show below.\n",
