    "\n",
    "For this activity, I am a public health researcher with a state government agency. For my current project, I need to identify counties in the United States that have the most and least births in the 2016-2018 time frame. Additionally, I am curious of the birth rate trend in update New York, specifically the Erie, Niagara, and Chautauqua counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the BigQuery public dataset called `sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality` with the full path `bigquery-public-data.sdoh_cdc_wonder_natality`. To view all the tables in this public dataset in BigQuery, I use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES view as follows:"

    "\n",
    "Simply sorting the dataset by the `Births` column and limiting the results to the top 10 rows would return the 10 rows with the lowest birth counts. However, the focus of this project is to identify the U. S. Counties with the lowest birth rates, and a simple sort like that could result in the same county appearing multiple times in the top 10. Therefore, I will use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by `County_of_Residence` to obtain the overall birth count for each county.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will also use multiple CASE statements to calculate the total number of births for each of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, as well as the overall total number of births across these years. The following SQL query was employed to extract the required data from the dataset:"
