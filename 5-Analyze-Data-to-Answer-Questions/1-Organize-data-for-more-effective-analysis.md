## Data analysis

***Data analysis*** is used to make sense of collected data, identify trends, and relationships to answer specific questions. To do this, you should stick to the 4 phases of analysis:

| Phase | Example: Buying a wedding gift |
| --- | --- |
| **Organize data** | Gift registry is like an organized dataset |
| **Format and adjust data** | Filter prices to include gifts that are within your budget |
| **Get input from others** | Wedding guests collaborate by marking off what they bought so you can inform yourself what not to buy |
| **Transform data** | Identifying relationships and patterns between the data points, you chose, purchased, and sent a gift that would answer the problem (liked gift that fits budget and that wasnâ€™t already purchased) you wanted to solve |

## Organize data for analysis

Keeping your data organized, whether you're using a spreadsheet or a database, significantly impacts your findings as it clarifies data classification and structure. Organized data enables you to easily capture and collect the information needed for analysis. Sorting arranges data in a meaningful order, while filtering displays only data that meets specific criteria. Combining filtering and sorting allows for organizing only relevant data for analysis.
